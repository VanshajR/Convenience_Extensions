# AutoQuote
AutoQuote is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to streamline the process of adding quotes around your code. It provides two commands that automatically insert single or double quotes and places the cursor between them for quick and efficient coding.
## Features

Insert Single Quotes: Press `Ctrl + '` to insert `, ''` and have your cursor automatically placed between the single quotes.
Insert Double Quotes: Press `Ctrl + Shift + '` to insert `, ""` with the cursor placed between the double quotes.
## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AutoQuote.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd AutoQuote
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Open the project in VS Code:

5. Use Debug mode from the command palette to launch the extension in a new VS Code window.
## Usage
- Insert Single Quotes `(Ctrl+')`:

    - Press `Ctrl+'` to insert a comma followed by single quotes and position the cursor between them.  
    Example:
    ```plaintext
    , '|' 
    ```
- Insert Double Quotes `(Ctrl+Shift+')`:

    - Press `Ctrl+Shit+'` to insert a comma followed by single quotes and position the cursor between them.  
    Example:
    ```plaintext
    , "|" 
    ```

## Remarks
I haven't published this feature to the extension marketplace yet because it requires more testing, but this should give you a general idea of how the README should look.
