- Follow the naming conventions and keep your code well-documented.
- Make sure the extension works before submitting your pull request.
- Include a **README.md** inside your extension folder explaining what your extension does and how to use it.
- Star this repository and give me a follow if you liked this idea!

I look forward to seeing your contributions!
Happy Developing!
